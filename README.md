# Sections

`sections.py` is a script to pull out Markdown-formatted headers from HTML sections. 

## Usage

```
pip install bs4
```

Add the HTML files you want to parse to the `/html` directory, then:

```
python script.py
```

Your parsed files will be located in `/parsed_html` as formatted `.txt` files.
